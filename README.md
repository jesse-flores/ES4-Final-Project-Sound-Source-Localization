# ES4-Final-Project-Sound-Source-Localization
This project implements a real-time acoustic direction-finding system that determines the compass direction of a sound source using three I2S MEMS microphones connected to an FPGA. The system displays the detected direction on eight LEDs representing the cardinal and intercardinal compass directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).
